# The "Like" Button
The goal of this exercise is to create an Instagram-style "like" button which is a stand-alone component that once clicked, will become active in color, increment the number of likes, and display the current like total.

## Installation
- Clone the repo
- Navigate to the folder and run `npm install`
- Start the server with `ng serve -o` (the `-o` flag opens a new browser window)
- Click some of the "like" hearts

## ToDo
Make the individual movies come from one JSON object of titles, descriptions, and like counts.
