# The "Like" Button
The goal of this exercise is to create an Instagram-style "like" button which is a stand-alone component that once clicked, will become active in color, increment the number of likes, and display the current like total.

I'm displaying movies from JSON data, each with a "Like" button which receives data for movie title, description, and numbe of likes.

## Installation
- Clone the repo
- Navigate to the folder and run `npm install`
- Start the server by running `ng serve -o` (the `-o` flag opens a new browser window)
- Click some of the "like" hearts to see it work

## ToDo
Pull random movies from OMDB Movie API to populate each movie, then show likes based on whateve critic ratings are in the data
