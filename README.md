# The "Like" Button
The goal of this exercise is to create an Instagram-style "like" button which is a stand-alone component that once clicked, will become active in color, increment the number of likes, and display the current like total.

## ToDo
Make the individual movies come from one JSON object of titles, descriptions, and like counts.
